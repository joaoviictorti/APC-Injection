# Overview

APC Injection is an attack technique that exploits Windows' ability to schedule asynchronous procedure calls (APCs). APCs are used to execute code in a process in a specific context, often as part of system operations. Attackers can exploit this functionality by injecting malicious code into a target process to execute their own instructions.
